There's a file called "test.txt" in the files folder of this lab Write a node application, called edit-file.js in the root of your project that:

Use the node fs module
Accepts a file name as a command line parameter
Reads in the contents of the file specified with the CLI (test it out with that test.txt file)
Creates a random value (using Math.random() or maybe faker()
Puts that random value into the file
Save the file
Re-Open and read the file contents
Emit a console.log() that shows the contents before and after the operations are completed.
